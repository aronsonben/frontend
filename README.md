<h1>README</h1>
<s>This project is a starting point for learning and practicing various front-end technologies, mainly React.js.</s><br />

Decided to just make this a ToDo-List demo, showcasing some work I've done while learning React.js.

Gratefully using <a href="https://github.com/ahfarmer/emoji-search">ahfarmer's 'emoji-search'</a> React example as a guideline to start.

Update 09/11/18: Got it up and published. Some quirks still, such as the local storage display. For now, items that were previously stored will be added to the list as a purplish color upon addition of the first new element. Hopefully will get that fixed soon. But mostly the major Todo-List functions work well!
